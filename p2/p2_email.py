    Hi {tup.name},

    I am {SENDER_NAME} from the California Department of Technology (CDT) and I am contacting you for a reference check for {tup.vendor_name} because this vendor has listed you as a reference for their eVAQ application with CDT. I have attached a one-page questionnaire for your review and comment. Could you please provide your answers to me so that I may have your reference on file for this vendor?  

    At the top of the attached questionnaire is {tup.vendor_name}â€™s information that they provided for their contract with your organization.  Question #1 is a verification that all of this information is correct which would give them a Pass rating.  If this information were incorrect, then they would receive a Fail rating.  The next 6 questions are explained in the attachment.  If you could return this questionnaire to me by {DATE}, it would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this matter.

    # We go up to the main project so that the p2 package is in the SEARCH PATH. This allows us to have the other modules in the p2 package in the search path which allows us to properly import or reference it when we run THIS script. 
    # In our main project, we can run our (main.py) script with no problem since we are referencing the specific package (absolute or relatively) for the imports in THIS module. Thus, there is no confusion in our main.py script where we are importing certain modules as everything is referenced properly (not ambiguously like "import html_body"). Doing an import without specifying the package (absolutely or relatively) is ONLY okay if we are in the main script as it will grab the closest module in the search path with the same name. Note, that this is also NOT recommended UNLESS the main.py script and the other module we are importing are on the SAME LEVEL.
