    Hi {tup.name},

    I am {SENDER_NAME} from the California Department of Technology (CDT) and I am contacting you for a reference check for {tup.vendor_name} because this vendor has listed you as a reference for their eVAQ application with CDT. I have attached a one-page questionnaire for your review and comment. Could you please provide your answers to me so that I may have your reference on file for this vendor?  

    At the top of the attached questionnaire is {tup.vendor_name}â€™s information that they provided for their contract with your organization.  Question #1 is a verification that all of this information is correct which would give them a Pass rating.  If this information were incorrect, then they would receive a Fail rating.  The next 6 questions are explained in the attachment.  If you could return this questionnaire to me by {DATE}, it would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this matter.
